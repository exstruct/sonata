# sonata

sql functions for elixir

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add sonata to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:sonata, "~> 0.1.0"}]
        end

  2. Ensure sonata is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:sonata]]
        end
